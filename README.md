# What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior
I replicate the figures in Enos (2016), "[What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enoschicago.pdf)," the data for which can be found on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26612).

The figures appear exactly as in the original. They show the "treatment" effect of the quasi-experimental demolishing of housing projects in Chicago on the voting behavior of the nearby white population. Overall, the figures underscore the paper's argument that white individuals living closer to the projects, or those living in an area where most of the neighborhood's black population was living in a demolished project, voted less after the projects came down. Enos argues that this is empirical evidence for the "racial threat" hypothesis.

The extension attempts to depict the key finding of the paper in a more visually compelling way. Using the mean treatment effects for four different categories of individuals, I illustrate that the white treatment groups show decreased voting turnout at closer distances than black treatment groups.
